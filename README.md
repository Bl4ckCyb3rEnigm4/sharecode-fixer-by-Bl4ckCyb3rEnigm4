# Thanks to GlacialMan for the testing.

>This is a tool created by me for nsane. I made this program in AutoIt from 
scratch, this one should work for every sharecode format.
Just start it, it's portable, no need to install it. I provided also the 
source code, in the case you'll use the code, you'll have to credit me.
When started the tool it will fix every sharecode you copy and it'll alert 
you using a notification. 
When you don't want to use the tool, just close it from the tray icon, by 
clicking on it with the right button and selection "close".
